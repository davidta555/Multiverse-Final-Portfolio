## Google Cloud Digital Leader Training Professional Certificate

One of the modules for Multiverse was self-directed. Since one of the goals for the cloud department at American Express was to obtain at least one cloud related certification, I decided on the self-directed module to be the Coursera's Google Cloud Digital Leader Training Professional Certificate. This helped me learn fundamental cloud terminology, learn how cloud technology and data can be leveraged to innovate within organizations, learn to identify Google Cloud products and solutions that support digital transformation, and finally learn to identify key change patterns and Google Cloud products for infrastructure and application modernization.
