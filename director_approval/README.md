## Director Approval

One of the features I have work on at American Express is the UI component to a new approval process for onboarding new project and services on our cloud platform (Hydra PaaS Platform).

The main audience for this feature are developers who want to start to create projects and services on the platform without having to wait for approval from their directors. In additiion, this feature is also for directors to more functionally in the application by approving or rejecting projects directly in Hydra.

The reasoning behind the need and creation for this feature was the unblocking of the developer workflow. Before this feature, the original process was on project creation, developer would have to wait for their sponsoring director to approve of the project via email. This process might takes days or even weeks depending on availability of the director.
