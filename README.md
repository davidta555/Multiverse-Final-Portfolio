# David Ta's Final Portfolio

This repository is a collection of some of my key learnings during my 2022 - 2023 apprenticeship at American Express.

## Overview of Apprenticeship
During my time on the full-stack cloud engineering team as a junior software engineer, I delivered value through improvements and added functionality in existing PaaS codebases while taking leadership of specfic features in American Express's cloud applications, such as director approval in Hydra UI. This document is a broad overview of my contributions to the company's services without revealing any sensitive information.

For security reasons, I will avoid using any code snippets and rely on descriptions.
